# Machine Learning

This repository contains code projects and write-ups about topics in statistics, probability and machine learning broadly.

Currently it serves to keep track of things I wish to explore more in the future.

### ToDo

#### Basic Neural Networks:

- [ ] Build basic FF neural network from scratch in torch
- [ ] Implement a GAN
- [ ] Implement a RNN (or some other sequence model)
- [ ] Ensemble learning


##### Recommender Systems

- [ ] Build a Recommender System

##### Graph Neural Networks 
- [ ] Experiment with Graph Neural Networks (using PyTorch Geometric library)

#### Statistics and Probablity Theory
- [ ] Some basic data exploration
- [ ] Monte-Carlo Simulation
- [ ] Hypothesis testing


 #### Deployment 
 - [ ] Explore options for deployment of ML models on Web and local applications
